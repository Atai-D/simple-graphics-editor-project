![Simple Graphics Editor](https://i.imgur.com/4iLNnyA.png)

In this project, you will develop a graphics editor using C++ and the Qt 6 framework, inspired by a simple user interface. The objective is to apply object-oriented programming principles to build a functional and extendable application. This project will allow you to explore graphical user interface development, event handling, and advanced OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

## Project Requirements

- Utilize the Qt 6 framework for all aspects of the user interface and graphics processing.

- Develop the basic functionality as depicted in the reference Figma [file](https://www.figma.com/file/0tIBwNWILXeboH6JPOxno2/Simple-Paint?type=design&node-id=0%3A3&mode=design&t=qEj0BXm98njEWCRe-1) with a simple drawing area.

- Implement menu options for file operations (new, open, save, save as, exit) and edit operations (undo, redo, cut, copy, paste).

- Provide tools to create at least lines, squares, and circles initially. Include options to select, move, and resize these shapes.

- Use [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) or your custom text-based serialization format to store vector image files.

- Structure your code using classes and objects, ensuring that it adheres to the principles of good object-oriented design. Use Design Patterns if possible and it helps.

## Additional Requirements:

- Innovate beyond the provided design by implementing additional features such as more drawing tools (e.g., triangles), layer management, and more. Apply your creativity to enhance the user interface and user experience.

## Deliverables

* Develop the editor within the `paint` directory. This time, you should organize the directory on your own.
